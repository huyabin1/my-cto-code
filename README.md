# my-cto-code

A Vue 2 + Three.js r158 project scaffold generated for the my-cto-code workspace.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` to access the editor shell. The default page displays a full-screen editor surface with a dedicated mount point for a Three.js scene.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run serve` – Start the development server with hot reloading.
- `npm run build` – Produce an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.
- `npm run lint` – Run ESLint using the Airbnb Base style guide with Prettier integration.
- `npm run format` – Format source and test files with Prettier.
- `npm run test:unit` – Execute unit tests with Jest and @vue/test-utils.
